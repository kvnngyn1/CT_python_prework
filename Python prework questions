#Python prework

#Question 1:
#Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" 
# USERNAME is the input of the function. 
# The first line of the code has been defined as below.
#
#    def hello_name(user_name):

def hello_name(user_name):
    print('hello_'+ user_name.upper()+ '!')

Hello_name('Kevin Naagooyen')

#Question 2:
#   Print first 100 odd numbers in Python.

start, end = 0, 200
for num in range(start, end):
   if num % 2 != 0:
      print(num, end = ", ")



#Question 3:
#Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. 
# #The first line of the code has been defined as below.
#
#    def max_num_in_list(a_list):

#Question 4:
#Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. 
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
# #The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

#Question 5:
#Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. 
# For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. 
# The return should be boolean Type.
